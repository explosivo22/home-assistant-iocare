1. Delete your current IOCare Integration from the Home Assistant Integrations page
   1. If you updated prior to deleting the integration, delete the integration, restart Home Assistant, and proceed to step 4
2. Update home-assistant-iocare via HACS or manually
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Initiate Config Flow by navigating to Configuration > Integrations > click the "+" button > find "Coway IoCare"
5. Enter your Coway IoCare credentials
